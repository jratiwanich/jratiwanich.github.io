# DOLOS-PLUS

This project is built using `npm` and `gulp`. For more information on build script, go to [GULP](http://gulpjs.com/).

## Getting Started
Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies require to do compile less, minify and run the web server. I'm using [browserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) as a web server to help with my multi-browsers testing and be compatible with Gulp streamline building.

## Running Web server
There are 2 ways to run this using `npm` or `gulp`.
#### 1) Using Gulp
Run `gulp browserSync` - this will just start the webserver with the default port: 3000

### 2) Using npm
Run `npm run start` to do the same thing above.

## Running Development server
There are 2 ways to run this using `npm` or `gulp`.
### 1) Using Gulp
Run `gulp dev` - this will compile less and minify css/js files and start the web server with [browserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/).

### 2) Using npm
Run 'npm run dev' to do the same thing above.
